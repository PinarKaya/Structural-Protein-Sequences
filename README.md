# Structural-Protein-Sequences  
## **Project:**     
In this Project we examined the structural properities of proteins.
The project contains varoius data preprocessing techniques to analyse and
clean a dataset.  
### **About The Dataset:**      
The dataset is about structural protein sequences that has been retrieved from
Research Colloboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) Protein Data Bank
(PDB) and kindly aknowledged.
The dataset contains protein meta data which includes details on protein
classification, extraction methods, etc.
